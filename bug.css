The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected when used with percentages and other units. For example, the following code is supposed to make an element 50% wide, and then subtract 10 pixels from its width. However, it does not work correctly in some browsers.

```css
#myElement {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```
